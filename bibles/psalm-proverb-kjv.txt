For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. -- psalms 75:6
.
But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. -- psalms 75:7
.
For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. -- psalms 75:8
.
But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. -- psalms 75:9
.
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted. -- psalms 75:10
.
In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. -- psalms 76:1
.
In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. -- psalms 76:2
.
There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. -- psalms 76:3
.
Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. -- psalms 76:4
.
The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. -- psalms 76:5
.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. -- psalms 76:6
.
Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? -- psalms 76:7
.
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, -- psalms 76:8
.
When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. -- psalms 76:9
.
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. -- psalms 76:10
.
Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. -- psalms 76:11
.
He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth. -- psalms 76:12
.
I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. -- psalms 77:1
.
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. -- psalms 77:2
.
I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. -- psalms 77:3
.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. -- psalms 77:4
.
I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. -- psalms 77:5
.
I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. -- psalms 77:6
.
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? -- psalms 77:7
.
Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? -- psalms 77:8
.
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. -- psalms 77:9
.
And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. -- psalms 77:10
.
I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. -- psalms 77:11
.
I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. -- psalms 77:12
.
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? -- psalms 77:13
.
Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. -- psalms 77:14
.
Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. -- psalms 77:15
.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. -- psalms 77:16
.
The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. -- psalms 77:17
.
The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. -- psalms 77:18
.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. -- psalms 77:19
.
Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. -- psalms 77:20
.
Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. -- psalms 78:1
.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: -- psalms 78:2
.
Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. -- psalms 78:3
.
We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. -- psalms 78:4
.
For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: -- psalms 78:5
.
That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: -- psalms 78:6
.
That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: -- psalms 78:7
.
And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. -- psalms 78:8
.
The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. -- psalms 78:9
.
They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; -- psalms 78:10
.
And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. -- psalms 78:11
.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. -- psalms 78:12
.
He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. -- psalms 78:13
.
In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. -- psalms 78:14
.
He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. -- psalms 78:15
.
He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. -- psalms 78:16
.
And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. -- psalms 78:17
.
And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. -- psalms 78:18
.
Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? -- psalms 78:19
.
Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? -- psalms 78:20
.
Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; -- psalms 78:21
.
Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: -- psalms 78:22
.
Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, -- psalms 78:23
.
And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. -- psalms 78:24
.
Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full. -- psalms 78:25
.
He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. -- psalms 78:26
.
He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: -- psalms 78:27
.
And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. -- psalms 78:28
.
So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; -- psalms 78:29
.
They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, -- psalms 78:30
.
The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. -- psalms 78:31
.
For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. -- psalms 78:32
.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. -- psalms 78:33
.
When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. -- psalms 78:34
.
And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. -- psalms 78:35
.
Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. -- psalms 78:36
.
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. -- psalms 78:37
.
But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. -- psalms 78:38
.
For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. -- psalms 78:39
.
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! -- psalms 78:40
.
Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. -- psalms 78:41
.
They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. -- psalms 78:42
.
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan. -- psalms 78:43
.
And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. -- psalms 78:44
.
He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. -- psalms 78:45
.
He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. -- psalms 78:46
.
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. -- psalms 78:47
.
He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. -- psalms 78:48
.
He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. -- psalms 78:49
.
He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; -- psalms 78:50
.
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: -- psalms 78:51
.
But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. -- psalms 78:52
.
And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. -- psalms 78:53
.
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. -- psalms 78:54
.
He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. -- psalms 78:55
.
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: -- psalms 78:56
.
But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. -- psalms 78:57
.
For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. -- psalms 78:58
.
When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: -- psalms 78:59
.
So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; -- psalms 78:60
.
And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. -- psalms 78:61
.
He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. -- psalms 78:62
.
The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. -- psalms 78:63
.
Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. -- psalms 78:64
.
Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. -- psalms 78:65
.
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. -- psalms 78:66
.
Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: -- psalms 78:67
.
But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. -- psalms 78:68
.
And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. -- psalms 78:69
.
He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: -- psalms 78:70
.
From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. -- psalms 78:71
.
So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. -- psalms 78:72
.
O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. -- psalms 79:1
.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. -- psalms 79:2
.
Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them. -- psalms 79:3
.
We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. -- psalms 79:4
.
How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? -- psalms 79:5
.
Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. -- psalms 79:6
.
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place. -- psalms 79:7
.
O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. -- psalms 79:8
.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. -- psalms 79:9
.
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed. -- psalms 79:10
.
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; -- psalms 79:11
.
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. -- psalms 79:12
.
So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations. -- psalms 79:13
.
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. -- psalms 80:1
.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us. -- psalms 80:2
.
Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. -- psalms 80:3
.
O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? -- psalms 80:4
.
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. -- psalms 80:5
.
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. -- psalms 80:6
.
Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. -- psalms 80:7
.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. -- psalms 80:8
.
Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. -- psalms 80:9
.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. -- psalms 80:10
.
She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. -- psalms 80:11
.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? -- psalms 80:12
.
The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. -- psalms 80:13
.
Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; -- psalms 80:14
.
And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. -- psalms 80:15
.
It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. -- psalms 80:16
.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. -- psalms 80:17
.
So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. -- psalms 80:18
.
Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. -- psalms 80:19
.
Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. -- psalms 81:1
.
Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. -- psalms 81:2
.
Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day. -- psalms 81:3
.
For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. -- psalms 81:4
.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not. -- psalms 81:5
.
I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. -- psalms 81:6
.
Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. -- psalms 81:7
.
Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; -- psalms 81:8
.
There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. -- psalms 81:9
.
I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. -- psalms 81:10
.
But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. -- psalms 81:11
.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels. -- psalms 81:12
.
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! -- psalms 81:13
.
I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. -- psalms 81:14
.
The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. -- psalms 81:15
.
He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee. -- psalms 81:16
.
God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. -- psalms 82:1
.
How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. -- psalms 82:2
.
Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. -- psalms 82:3
.
Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. -- psalms 82:4
.
They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. -- psalms 82:5
.
I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. -- psalms 82:6
.
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. -- psalms 82:7
.
Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations. -- psalms 82:8
.
Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. -- psalms 83:1
.
For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. -- psalms 83:2
.
They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. -- psalms 83:3
.
They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. -- psalms 83:4
.
For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: -- psalms 83:5
.
The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; -- psalms 83:6
.
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; -- psalms 83:7
.
Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. -- psalms 83:8
.
Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: -- psalms 83:9
.
Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. -- psalms 83:10
.
Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: -- psalms 83:11
.
Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. -- psalms 83:12
.
O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. -- psalms 83:13
.
As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; -- psalms 83:14
.
So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. -- psalms 83:15
.
Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. -- psalms 83:16
.
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: -- psalms 83:17
.
That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth. -- psalms 83:18
.
How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! -- psalms 84:1
.
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. -- psalms 84:2
.
Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. -- psalms 84:3
.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah. -- psalms 84:4
.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them. -- psalms 84:5
.
Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools. -- psalms 84:6
.
They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God. -- psalms 84:7
.
O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. -- psalms 84:8
.
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. -- psalms 84:9
.
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. -- psalms 84:10
.
For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. -- psalms 84:11
.
O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee. -- psalms 84:12
.
Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. -- psalms 85:1
.
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah. -- psalms 85:2
.
Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. -- psalms 85:3
.
Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease. -- psalms 85:4
.
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? -- psalms 85:5
.
Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? -- psalms 85:6
.
Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. -- psalms 85:7
.
I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. -- psalms 85:8
.
Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. -- psalms 85:9
.
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. -- psalms 85:10
.
Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. -- psalms 85:11
.
Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. -- psalms 85:12
.
Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps. -- psalms 85:13
.
Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy. -- psalms 86:1
.
Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. -- psalms 86:2
.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. -- psalms 86:3
.
Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. -- psalms 86:4
.
For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. -- psalms 86:5
.
Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. -- psalms 86:6
.
In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. -- psalms 86:7
.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. -- psalms 86:8
.
All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. -- psalms 86:9
.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone. -- psalms 86:10
.
Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. -- psalms 86:11
.
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. -- psalms 86:12
.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. -- psalms 86:13
.
O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them. -- psalms 86:14
.
But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. -- psalms 86:15
.
O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. -- psalms 86:16
.
Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me. -- psalms 86:17
.
His foundation is in the holy mountains. -- psalms 87:1
.
The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. -- psalms 87:2
.
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. -- psalms 87:3
.
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there. -- psalms 87:4
.
And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. -- psalms 87:5
.
The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. -- psalms 87:6
.
As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee. -- psalms 87:7
.
O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: -- psalms 88:1
.
Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry; -- psalms 88:2
.
For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. -- psalms 88:3
.
I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength: -- psalms 88:4
.

.
He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever. -- psalms 103:9
.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. -- psalms 103:10
.
For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. -- psalms 103:11
.
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. -- psalms 103:12

.
As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. -- psalms 103:15

.
Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: -- psalms 104:2
.
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: -- psalms 104:3
.
Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: -- psalms 104:4
.
Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. -- psalms 104:5
.
Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. -- psalms 104:6
.
At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. -- psalms 104:7

He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. -- psalms 104:13
.
He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; -- psalms 104:14
.
And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart. -- psalms 104:15

.
Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. -- psalms 104:17
.
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies. -- psalms 104:18

.
That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. -- psalms 104:28
.
Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. -- psalms 104:29

Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. -- psalms 104:30
.
The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. -- psalms 104:31

He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. -- psalms 105:8
.
Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; -- psalms 105:9
.
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: -- psalms 105:10
.
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: -- psalms 105:11
.
When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. -- psalms 105:12
.
When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; -- psalms 105:13

.
Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. -- psalms 105:15
.
Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. -- psalms 105:16
.
He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: -- psalms 105:17

Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: -- psalms 105:18
.
Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. -- psalms 105:19
.
The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. -- psalms 105:20

He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. -- psalms 105:32
.
He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. -- psalms 105:33
.
He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, -- psalms 105:34
.
And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. -- psalms 105:35
.
He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. -- psalms 105:36

.
He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. -- psalms 105:39
.
The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. -- psalms 105:40
.
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. -- psalms 105:41
.
For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. -- psalms 105:42
.
And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: -- psalms 105:43

.
That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. -- psalms 105:45

.
We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. -- psalms 106:6
.
Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. -- psalms 106:7
.
Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. -- psalms 106:8
.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. -- psalms 106:9
.
And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. -- psalms 106:10
.
And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. -- psalms 106:11
.
Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. -- psalms 106:12
.
They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: -- psalms 106:13
.
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. -- psalms 106:14
.
And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. -- psalms 106:15
.
They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. -- psalms 106:16
.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram. -- psalms 106:17
.
And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. -- psalms 106:18
.
They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. -- psalms 106:19
.
Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. -- psalms 106:20
.
They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; -- psalms 106:21
.
Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. -- psalms 106:22
.
Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. -- psalms 106:23
.
Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: -- psalms 106:24
.
But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. -- psalms 106:25
.
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: -- psalms 106:26
.
To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. -- psalms 106:27
.
They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. -- psalms 106:28
.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. -- psalms 106:29
.
Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. -- psalms 106:30
.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. -- psalms 106:31
.
They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: -- psalms 106:32
.
Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. -- psalms 106:33
.
They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: -- psalms 106:34
.
But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. -- psalms 106:35
.
And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. -- psalms 106:36
.
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, -- psalms 106:37
.
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. -- psalms 106:38
.
Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. -- psalms 106:39
.
Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. -- psalms 106:40
.
And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. -- psalms 106:41
.
Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. -- psalms 106:42
.
Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. -- psalms 106:43
.
Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: -- psalms 106:44
.
And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. -- psalms 106:45
.
He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. -- psalms 106:46
.
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. -- psalms 106:47
.
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. -- psalms 106:48
.
O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. -- psalms 107:1
.
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; -- psalms 107:2
.
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. -- psalms 107:3
.
They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. -- psalms 107:4
.
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. -- psalms 107:5
.
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. -- psalms 107:6
.
And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. -- psalms 107:7
.
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! -- psalms 107:8
.
For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. -- psalms 107:9
.
Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; -- psalms 107:10
.
Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: -- psalms 107:11
.
Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. -- psalms 107:12
.
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. -- psalms 107:13
.
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. -- psalms 107:14
.
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! -- psalms 107:15
.
For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. -- psalms 107:16
.
Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. -- psalms 107:17
.
Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. -- psalms 107:18
.
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. -- psalms 107:19
.
He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. -- psalms 107:20
.
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! -- psalms 107:21
.
And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. -- psalms 107:22
.
They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; -- psalms 107:23
.
These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. -- psalms 107:24
.
For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. -- psalms 107:25
.
They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. -- psalms 107:26
.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end. -- psalms 107:27
.
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. -- psalms 107:28
.
He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. -- psalms 107:29
.
Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. -- psalms 107:30
.
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! -- psalms 107:31
.
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. -- psalms 107:32
.
He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; -- psalms 107:33
.
A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. -- psalms 107:34
.
He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. -- psalms 107:35
.
And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; -- psalms 107:36
.
And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. -- psalms 107:37
.
He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. -- psalms 107:38
.
Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. -- psalms 107:39
.
He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. -- psalms 107:40

.
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. -- psalms 108:7

.
As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. -- psalms 109:17

Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. -- proverbs 30:20
.

.

The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. -- ecclesiastes 1:1
.
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 1:2
.
What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? -- ecclesiastes 1:3
.
One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. -- ecclesiastes 1:4
.
The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. -- ecclesiastes 1:5
.
The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. -- ecclesiastes 1:6
.
All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. -- ecclesiastes 1:7
.
All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. -- ecclesiastes 1:8
.
The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 1:9
.
Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. -- ecclesiastes 1:10
.
There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. -- ecclesiastes 1:11
.
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. -- ecclesiastes 1:12
.
And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. -- ecclesiastes 1:13
.
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 1:14
.
That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. -- ecclesiastes 1:15
.
I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. -- ecclesiastes 1:16
.
And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 1:17
.
For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. -- ecclesiastes 1:18
.
I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 2:1
.
I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? -- ecclesiastes 2:2
.
I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. -- ecclesiastes 2:3
.
I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: -- ecclesiastes 2:4
.
I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: -- ecclesiastes 2:5
.
I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: -- ecclesiastes 2:6
.
I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: -- ecclesiastes 2:7
.
I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts. -- ecclesiastes 2:8
.
So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. -- ecclesiastes 2:9
.
And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. -- ecclesiastes 2:10
.
Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 2:11
.
And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done. -- ecclesiastes 2:12
.
Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. -- ecclesiastes 2:13
.
The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. -- ecclesiastes 2:14
.
Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 2:15
.
For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool. -- ecclesiastes 2:16
.
Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 2:17
.
Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. -- ecclesiastes 2:18
.
And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity. -- ecclesiastes 2:19
.
Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 2:20
.
For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. -- ecclesiastes 2:21
.
For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? -- ecclesiastes 2:22
.
For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. -- ecclesiastes 2:23
.
There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. -- ecclesiastes 2:24
.
For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I? -- ecclesiastes 2:25
.
For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 2:26
.
To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: -- ecclesiastes 3:1
.
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; -- ecclesiastes 3:2
.
A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; -- ecclesiastes 3:3
.
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; -- ecclesiastes 3:4
.
A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; -- ecclesiastes 3:5
.
A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; -- ecclesiastes 3:6
.
A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; -- ecclesiastes 3:7
.
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. -- ecclesiastes 3:8
.
What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? -- ecclesiastes 3:9
.
I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. -- ecclesiastes 3:10
.
He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. -- ecclesiastes 3:11
.
I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life. -- ecclesiastes 3:12
.
And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God. -- ecclesiastes 3:13
.
I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him. -- ecclesiastes 3:14
.
That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. -- ecclesiastes 3:15
.
And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there. -- ecclesiastes 3:16
.
I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. -- ecclesiastes 3:17
.
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. -- ecclesiastes 3:18
.
For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 3:19
.
All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. -- ecclesiastes 3:20
.
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? -- ecclesiastes 3:21
.
Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him? -- ecclesiastes 3:22
.
So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. -- ecclesiastes 4:1
.
Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. -- ecclesiastes 4:2
.
Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 4:3
.
Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 4:4
.
The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. -- ecclesiastes 4:5
.
Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 4:6
.
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 4:7
.
There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. -- ecclesiastes 4:8
.
Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. -- ecclesiastes 4:9
.
For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. -- ecclesiastes 4:10
.
Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? -- ecclesiastes 4:11
.
And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. -- ecclesiastes 4:12
.
Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished. -- ecclesiastes 4:13
.
For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor. -- ecclesiastes 4:14
.
I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. -- ecclesiastes 4:15
.
There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 4:16
.
Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. -- ecclesiastes 5:1
.
Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. -- ecclesiastes 5:2
.
For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words. -- ecclesiastes 5:3
.
When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. -- ecclesiastes 5:4
.
Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. -- ecclesiastes 5:5
.
Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? -- ecclesiastes 5:6
.
For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God. -- ecclesiastes 5:7
.
If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they. -- ecclesiastes 5:8
.
Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field. -- ecclesiastes 5:9
.
He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity. -- ecclesiastes 5:10
.
When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? -- ecclesiastes 5:11
.
The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. -- ecclesiastes 5:12
.
There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. -- ecclesiastes 5:13
.
But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand. -- ecclesiastes 5:14
.
As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. -- ecclesiastes 5:15
.
And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? -- ecclesiastes 5:16
.
All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness. -- ecclesiastes 5:17
.
Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion. -- ecclesiastes 5:18
.
Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God. -- ecclesiastes 5:19
.
For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart. -- ecclesiastes 5:20
.
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men: -- ecclesiastes 6:1
.
A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease. -- ecclesiastes 6:2
.
If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he. -- ecclesiastes 6:3
.
For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness. -- ecclesiastes 6:4
.
Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other. -- ecclesiastes 6:5
.
Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place? -- ecclesiastes 6:6
.
All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. -- ecclesiastes 6:7
.
For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living? -- ecclesiastes 6:8
.
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit. -- ecclesiastes 6:9
.
That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he. -- ecclesiastes 6:10
.
Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better? -- ecclesiastes 6:11
.
For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? -- ecclesiastes 6:12
.
A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. -- ecclesiastes 7:1
.
It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. -- ecclesiastes 7:2
.
Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. -- ecclesiastes 7:3
.
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. -- ecclesiastes 7:4
.
It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. -- ecclesiastes 7:5
.
For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 7:6
.
Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. -- ecclesiastes 7:7
.
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. -- ecclesiastes 7:8
.
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. -- ecclesiastes 7:9
.
Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. -- ecclesiastes 7:10
.
Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun. -- ecclesiastes 7:11
.
For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it. -- ecclesiastes 7:12
.
Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked? -- ecclesiastes 7:13
.
In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. -- ecclesiastes 7:14
.
All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. -- ecclesiastes 7:15
.
Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ? -- ecclesiastes 7:16
.
Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? -- ecclesiastes 7:17
.
It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. -- ecclesiastes 7:18
.
Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. -- ecclesiastes 7:19
.
For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. -- ecclesiastes 7:20
.
Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: -- ecclesiastes 7:21
.
For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. -- ecclesiastes 7:22
.
All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me. -- ecclesiastes 7:23
.
That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? -- ecclesiastes 7:24
.
I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness: -- ecclesiastes 7:25
.
And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. -- ecclesiastes 7:26
.
Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account: -- ecclesiastes 7:27
.
Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. -- ecclesiastes 7:28
.
Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. -- ecclesiastes 7:29
.
Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed. -- ecclesiastes 8:1
.
I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God. -- ecclesiastes 8:2
.
Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. -- ecclesiastes 8:3
.
Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? -- ecclesiastes 8:4
.
Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment. -- ecclesiastes 8:5
.
Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him. -- ecclesiastes 8:6
.
For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? -- ecclesiastes 8:7
.
There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it. -- ecclesiastes 8:8
.
All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. -- ecclesiastes 8:9
.
And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity. -- ecclesiastes 8:10
.
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. -- ecclesiastes 8:11
.
Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: -- ecclesiastes 8:12
.
But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God. -- ecclesiastes 8:13
.
There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 8:14
.
Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 8:15
.
When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) -- ecclesiastes 8:16
.
Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it. -- ecclesiastes 8:17
.
For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them. -- ecclesiastes 9:1
.
All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. -- ecclesiastes 9:2
.
This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. -- ecclesiastes 9:3
.
For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion. -- ecclesiastes 9:4
.
For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. -- ecclesiastes 9:5
.
Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 9:6
.
Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works. -- ecclesiastes 9:7
.
Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment. -- ecclesiastes 9:8
.
Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun. -- ecclesiastes 9:9
.
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. -- ecclesiastes 9:10
.
I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. -- ecclesiastes 9:11
.
For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them. -- ecclesiastes 9:12
.
This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me: -- ecclesiastes 9:13
.
There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it: -- ecclesiastes 9:14
.
Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. -- ecclesiastes 9:15
.
Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard. -- ecclesiastes 9:16
.
The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools. -- ecclesiastes 9:17
.
Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good. -- ecclesiastes 9:18
.
Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. -- ecclesiastes 10:1
.
A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. -- ecclesiastes 10:2
.
Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. -- ecclesiastes 10:3
.
If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. -- ecclesiastes 10:4
.
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: -- ecclesiastes 10:5
.
Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. -- ecclesiastes 10:6
.

.
Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. -- ecclesiastes 10:9
.
If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. -- ecclesiastes 10:10
.
Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. -- ecclesiastes 10:11
.
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. -- ecclesiastes 10:12
.
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. -- ecclesiastes 10:13
.
A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? -- ecclesiastes 10:14
.
The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. -- ecclesiastes 10:15
.

.
Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. -- ecclesiastes 11:1
.
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. -- ecclesiastes 11:2
.
If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. -- ecclesiastes 11:3
.
He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. -- ecclesiastes 11:4

.
But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. -- ecclesiastes 11:8
.

.
Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity. -- ecclesiastes 11:10
.
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; -- ecclesiastes 12:1
